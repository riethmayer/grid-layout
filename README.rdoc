= grid-layout

This Project was intended to replace the nifty_layout part of Ryan Bates great nifty-generators.
I took 960.gs, and created macros like compass does, but only for the very basic stuff.
It's as minimalistic as 960.gs, that's why it should get out of your way.

I added maybe a little bit too much regarding directory structure.
But it fits my needs somehow.

== Usage

0. gem install grid-layout
1. create your rails project (rails foo)
2. go into foo (cd foo)
3. haml --rails . (activate haml for rails)
4. script/generate grid_layout


== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
